# Unified Sales Warehouse

A full-stack data warehouse solution designed to integrate and analyze business sales data from CRM and ERP systems. The project leverages the **Medallion Architecture** to organize data into distinct layers for traceability, quality, and analytical readiness.

## Data Flow Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/data_flow.png" width="700"/>
</p>

This architecture illustrates the movement of data from **raw Excel files** to an analytical-ready **Star Schema** model.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources

- **CRM System:** Provides sales, customer, and product information.
- **ERP System:** Provides additional customer info, product categories, locations, and attributes.
---

## üîÑ ETL Pipeline ‚Äì SSIS + SQL Server

The data is processed through three distinct layers using a combination of **SSIS packages**, **stored procedures**, and **T-SQL scripts**:

---

### üü´ Bronze Layer ‚Äì Raw Zone

- Raw data from CRM & ERP Excel files.
- Loaded into SQL Server using **SSIS**.
- Stored in a schema called `bronze`.
- Tables include:
  - `crm_sales_details`
  - `crm_cust_info`
  - `crm_prd_info`
  - `erp_cust_az12`
  - `erp_loc_a101`
  - `erp_px_cat_g1v2`

---

### üü™ Silver Layer ‚Äì Cleansed & Transformed

- Data is copied from Bronze using `TRUNCATE + INSERT INTO` via **stored procedures**.
- Business rules and data transformations are applied using **T-SQL**.
- Stored in schema `silver`.
- Standardization of data types, removal of duplicates, and relational joins are applied.
- Same tables exist with cleaned content:
  - `crm_sales_details`
  - `crm_cust_info`
  - `crm_prd_info`
  - `erp_cust_az12`
  - `erp_loc_a101`
  - `erp_px_cat_g1v2`

---

### üü® Gold Layer ‚Äì Analytics & Star Schema

- Final analytical views are created in the `gold` schema.
- Data is modeled using **Star Schema** (Sales Data Mart).
- No physical tables: all are **SQL views** for performance and flexibility.
- The model includes:
  - **Fact Table**: `fact_sales`
  - **Dimension Tables**: `dim_customers`, `dim_products`
